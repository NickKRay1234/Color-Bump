# Color-Bump
An analogue of the popular game for Android and IOS based on the Udemy course with a complete redesign of the code based on the SOLID principles. Added 3D models of own production on Blender in chess style.
The goal of the game is to pass the levels touching the figures only of their own color and not touching the opposite. Bypass enemy static and dynamic figures.
